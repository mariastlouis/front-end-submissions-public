# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/jdursema/COGovernorTracker/blob/ee11d70c3fe7696383c2fb600d93e6100be72116/server.js#L96)

* We're proud because we got the query parameter working and pulling in the zip code. This was a bit of a struggle. 

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/jdursema/COGovernorTracker/blob/ee11d70c3fe7696383c2fb600d93e6100be72116/server.js#L96)

* The same block of code - it works but it could be shorter and more concise. Needs refactoring.
